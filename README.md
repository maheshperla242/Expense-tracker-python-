Skills Used:

Python

Pandas (Data handling & analysis)

Matplotlib (Data visualization)

CSV file handling

Basic Data Analysis

Key Features:

Add Expenses – Record daily expenses with date, category, amount, and description.

View Expenses – Display all recorded expenses in a clean tabular format.

Analyze Expenses –

Calculate total expenses.

Categorize expenses and show summaries.

Generate Bar Chart for monthly expense trends.

Data Storage – Save all expense data in a CSV file for persistence.

User-Friendly Menu – Simple console-based interface for easy navigation.

Implementation Steps:

Create a CSV file (expenses.csv) to store data.

Use Pandas to read and write data efficiently.

Implement functions: add_expense(), view_expenses(), and analyze_expenses().

Use Matplotlib for visual representation of expense data.

Create a main menu to allow users to select tasks interactively.

Outcome / Results:
